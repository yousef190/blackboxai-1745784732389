# Secure Auth System

## Project Overview

The Secure Auth System is a production-ready Node.js authentication system that supports both manual logins and GitHub OAuth to enhance your application's security. It employs best practices for managing user sessions, including CSRF protection and password hashing.

## Installation

To install the Secure Auth System, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/secure-auth-system.git
   cd secure-auth-system
   ```

2. **Install the dependencies**:
   Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or higher) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) installed. Then run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and configure it with the following variables:
   ```plaintext
   DATABASE_URL=your_postgres_connection_string
   SESSION_SECRET=your_session_secret
   NODE_ENV=development # or production
   ```

4. **Initialize the database**:
   Ensure that you have a PostgreSQL database set up and your connection string is properly configured.

5. **Start the application**:
   You can run the application using the following command:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   For development mode, use:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can access it at `http://localhost:3000`. 

### Authentication Workflow

- Users can register and log in via a standard form or choose GitHub OAuth for authentication.
- Upon successful login, users are redirected to the dashboard.

### Example Routes
- **Login**: `GET /login` 
- **Logout**: `GET /logout`
- **Dashboard**: `GET /dashboard` (protected route)

Ensure you handle CSRF tokens properly on forms to prevent cross-site request forgery.

## Features

- User authentication via manual login and GitHub OAuth.
- Passwords are securely hashed using bcrypt.
- Sessions are managed using PostgreSQL for persistent and secure storage.
- CSRF protection is in place to safeguard against CSRF attacks.
- Flash messages for providing feedback on authentication processes.
- Secure HTTP headers through Helmet for added security.

## Dependencies

The project uses the following npm packages:

- **bcrypt**: Password hashing.
- **connect-pg-simple**: PostgreSQL session store for Express sessions.
- **csurf**: CSRF protection middleware.
- **dotenv**: Environment variable management.
- **ejs**: Template engine for rendering views.
- **express**: Web framework for Node.js.
- **express-flash**: Flash messages middleware.
- **express-session**: Session management middleware.
- **helmet**: Middleware to set HTTP headers for security.
- **passport**: Authentication middleware for Node.js.
- **passport-github2**: GitHub OAuth 2.0 strategy for Passport.
- **pg**: PostgreSQL client for Node.js.

### Development Dependencies

- **nodemon**: Development tool that automatically restarts the server on file changes.
